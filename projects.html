            A Scratch project I started in early 2022 and was practically inspired from Karlson, a unity game made by famous game dev Dani(dont know why hes inactive now;-;).
            anyway the game was supposed to be a speed based platformer but unfortunately due to my low coding skill at that time it turned out to be glitchy buggy, and overall 
            difficult to implement levels and such. I have recently started a new retake on the game and will probably be better. With much better animations for the player too
